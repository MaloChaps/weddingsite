					I was the sole designer working on the redesign of Profile. I partnered closely with the Product Foundation team as well as design leads from other platforms (News Feed, Pages, Groups, Marketplace, Watch) to create unified components that could easily be adapted for each surface. Some of the components included in this redesign were: Composer, Site Nav, Page Nav, Tabs, Posts, Menus, and Forms.<br><br>

					Additionally, I worked closely with my cross-functional partners (Project Manager, Data Scientist, Research, Engineering) to ensure that the experience was uncompromised in its features when used to express identity.<br><br>

					Shipped on iOS, Android, FBlite, and web.</p>
